            Poets have the gift of expression. The power of words, metaphors and
            stories cannot be underestimated in the context of how they
            influence a crowd. When creativity meets social commitment, somehow
            the sound is louder and the intent, clearer. We, the people of
            Desire are always on the lookout for people who can contribute to
            our cause in whatever little way possible. What better than
            collaborating with the most creative minds of the city to create an
            afternoon full of poetry and music? Hence, we talked about
            childhood, schooldays, had an awesome musical performance and last
            but not the least, some beautiful rhymes from the kids.

            The members of Desire Foundation went to Mahimanagar slum in
            Bhubaneshwar to spread happiness and joy on the occasion of Diwali.
            The idea was to celebrate Diwali in a non- conventional approach
            while making it jolly for the children in the slum as well as be
            eco-friendly. Card making competition was organised and crayon sets
            were given out as prizes. Food packets and chocolates were also
            distributed among those 50 children. Diyas were also distributed to
            40 families.

            RICE BUCKET CHALLENGE

            Originally initiated in Hyderabad, Desire took part in the Rice
            Bucket Challenge on 29th August 2014, donating 61 Kgs of rice to 61
            families. Further we nominated KAASH, NSS, Parivartan and RON. It
            was a bright-eyed initiative that addressed the issue ‘absence of
            proper food for the deprived section of our community’. Such
            initiatives might bring a significant change in their nutritional
            requirements.

          It is an initiative to financially help the underprivileged children.
          We achieved this with the help of crowdfunding and communicated with
          various organizations for sponsorship. We completed our 1st phase of
          Ek Nayi Umeed on February 2017. In phase 1, we helped a girl named
          Tarini who aspires to become a doctor in the future. We helped her
          through a crowdfunding website, Ketto and supported her to take a firm
          step towards her dream.The story of Tarini was then uploaded on Ketto.
          We marketized the donation link and collected around Rs. 12,000. A
          fixed amount of money is given to her as scholarship.
