          To bring equal educational opportunities to the disadvantaged sections
          of the society by utilizing youth as a resource, thereby making them
          socially responsible and increasing access to education. We aim at a

          education. We also target to utilise the exquisite minds of the youth
          of our country by bringing them together for a greater good while
          being instrumental in their growth. Our goal is to bridge the gap
          between the wealthy and the impoverished sections of the community.
          Every educated child represents a brighter future for our country.

        <br />
        <p>
          A society with equal access to the basic humanitarian rights and
          educational opportunities irrespective of caste, creed, gender and
          financial background. We envision a community where not even a single
          person should feel the lack of basic human rights food, clothing,
          shelter and education. A community where no one has to fight for
          availing nutritious food, for having a roof to sleep under, for
          acquiring quality education and receiving a chance to a radiant
          future. A community where there is no price tag on dreaming and
          achieving.

        <br />
        <p>
          Desire Foundation was established by a group of like-minded college
          students wanting to give back to the society. We started with the idea
          to tackle the need of basic amenities like proper shelter for the
          economically feeble section of the society. We lit up the houses in
          slums of Bhubaneswar through an eco-friendly approach. Then broadened
          our focus by addressing the issue of availability of proper food for
          the underprivileged section of our society. Further diversifying our
          horizons and shifting our focus majorly on their educational rights.
          Education in our opinion is a more holistic approach to tackle all the
          above-mentioned issues. Education creates the opportunity for leading
          a more upstanding lifestyle by getting proper food, shelter and
          clothing. We brought together the brightest and sharpest minds of the
          youth in our community to be a part of this transformation. The
          foundation started in the year 2014.
