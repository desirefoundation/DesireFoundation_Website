            Adhyayan, which means, to study, is exactly what this project is all
            about. Adhyayan strives to provide equal educational opportunities
            to the children of EWS of the society under the ambit of RTE Act
            12(1)(c) by using the youth as a resource. This section under the
            RTE Act mandates 25% reservation for the children from economically
            and socially weaker sections in private primary schools free of
            cost.

            Books for primary standard students from a financially weaker
            section of the society were arranged by exchanging books from all
            over the community that were not required by the people anymore.
            This was a gleaming initiative to help the children belonging to the
            economically feeble section of the society to avail quality books
            free of cost.

            This year, Desire foundation took a step forward with its first
            initiative in Mumbai through "AAHAR". We were able to provide
            freshly cooked meals to over 300 blind and homeless kids, and
            children belonging to the underprivileged sections of the society.
            In association with BOX8-Desi Meals, Desire Foundation was
            successful in providing meals, covering areas of Navi Mumbai and
            Mumbai especially the slums in Kopar Khairane.

          In 2015, Desire Foundation took steps to illuminate houses in the
          slums of Bhubaneshwar which were still in darkness. Originated in
          Brazil, this is an eco-friendly and long-lasting way to light homes!
          Our project in 2014 turned into an international initiative by Liter
          Of Light global in 2017.
