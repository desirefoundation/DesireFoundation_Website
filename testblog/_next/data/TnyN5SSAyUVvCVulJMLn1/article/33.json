I had a whole lot of new experiences working here. Work has always been fun because we love what we do. I would like to share a small story, the first event that I was a part of after joining Desire was the Independence Day project. We went to PATHANI SAMANTHA a government school near campus 13 of kiit university. We organized various quizzes and tasks among students, like sit and Draw competition for students up to 5th standard, and the  drawings by those kids left me astonished . Prizes were given to top performers and chocolates were distributed among kids. I was overwhelmed seeing those kids smiling. It left an ever-lasting impression in my heart. It’s a pleasure seeing someone smile and if you are the reason behind that smile, it is the best feeling.</p><p></p>","blog_headline":"My Journey","user_email":null,"user_insta":"https://instagram.com/ayush.gautam155?igshid=1o00k1fe5x391","user_facebook":null,"user_linkedin":null,"user_name":"Ayush Gautam","create_timestamp":"2020-08-23T10:35:23.000Z","header_img_path":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1fXtyTWfXDEtqfKCQec1ZjYR3JUrz8gFj"}],"id":"33"},"__N_SSG":true}
