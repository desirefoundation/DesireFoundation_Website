They are 13 and 17 respectively. Rahul is a little confused about what he must and mustn’t do during the pandemic. Rajeev helps him figuring out his dilemma. Let’s hear their conversation!</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rahul: But why is everyone sharing information on social media regarding oxygen supplies?</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rajeev: Because, Rahul, the country is facing a serious shortage of medical supplies including the provision of oxygen. The ones affected by COVID are suffering due to this shortage and people are trying to help those in need by sharing information they have gathered and verified! It’s kind of a noble cause, actually. We should do it too.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rahul: Can’t the affected people take oxygen from hospitals and nursing homes near them? </span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rajeev: Several hospitals and nursing homes are facing a crisis due to the massive inflow of COVID patients in the past month. In this situation, what would your near and dear ones do other than asking for help?</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rahul: Oh, I get it. I’m relieved that the vaccines have been made. Now we can take it and lead a normal life again!</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rajeev: The vaccines have been administered to many citizens across the country. But for the vaccines to reach youngsters, there is still time. First, we are securing the ones with lower immunity.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rahul: My parents want to get vaccinated. How can they do that? </span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rajeev: They can register </span><a href=\"https://www.cowin.gov.in/home\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"> or look for the same in their localities.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rahul: I can’t wait to roam around mask-free after I take the vaccine! </span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rajeev: Don’t dare do it! The vaccines, although tested are not 100% effective on every person. Even after administering the vaccine, we must continue to wear a mask and maintain social distancing. You can know more about the vaccine </span><a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rahul: But aren’t we safe with our immunity and the strength provided by the vaccine? Why then should we wear a mask?</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rajeev: We maybe safe from the strain of the virus. But our near ones might not be! It is for them that we must definitely maintain all the protocols and stay safe from the virus.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rahul: I was thinking of convincing our parents to go for a vacation! What do you say?</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rajeev: It is really irresponsible of you to think this way, Rahul! People are being affected everyday and suffering from the talons of the deadly disease. We have to live responsibly. The government has also released some </span><a href=\"https://inshorts.com/en/news/govt-releases-list-of-dos-and-donts-for-plasma-donation-amid-covid19-surge-1619360622862?utm_source=news_share\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">do’s and don’ts</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"> regarding several topics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rahul: But I see so many people travelling and having fun!</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rajeev: Every person is different. It maybe useless to make some people understand the devastating consequences of their actions, but you, Rahul, are a smart boy. You should know that this is not a vacation you’re on. You must be active and work positively by staying indoors and putting on a mask whenever you go out.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rahul: What should someone do if I they think they have caught it?</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rajeev: If someone </span><span style=\"color: rgb(34,34,34);background-color: white;font-size: 14pt;\">suffers from a common cold, cough, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath and fatigue, they must isolate themselves and contact your doctor immediately.</span><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"> That’s how they can prevent the spread of the illness! There are </span><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/detailsid=com.healthsignz.consumer.tenet&hl=en_IN&gl=US\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">apps</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"> that allow everyone to take the test sitting at home.</span> They can also get an <a href=\"https://doctor365.co.in/\" target=\"_blank\">online consultation</a> from doctors.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rahul: What else can I do to stay healthy? I really want to develop my immune system and fight the virus!</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rajeev: That’s easy. You must stay indoors, keep safe distance from others, put on a mask, go out only when necessary, wash your hands after regular intervals, use sanitizers, take your medication, drink lots of water, take necessary vitamins and stay positive. </span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rahul: What about the money we use? Isn’t that capable of transmitting the disease?</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rajeev: It’s true. What we can do is try to use online modes of payment like </span><a href=\"https://pay.google.com/intl/en_in/about/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwyZmEBhCpARIsALIzmnKvy1e5Augz4my4cbhnZlcvFHbDAxqm6OziEZeFrnAQDTBtdU63YusaAsTaEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Google Pay</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.phonepe.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">PhonePe</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">, </span><a href=\"https://paytm.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Paytm</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">, etc. whenever we can and definitely sanitize the notes or coins we bring home. Safety comes before anything!</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rahul: That seems so easy to follow! I will definitely do these and punch the virus away. </span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Rajeev: That’s great Rahul. I hope you will live responsibly from now on and provide a service to the society.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><ins>IMPORTANT LINKS MENTIONED:</ins></strong></span><strong><ins> </ins></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">About the Vaccine</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"> </span></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cowin.gov.in/home\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Registration for the Vaccine</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"> </span></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/detailsid=com.healthsignz.consumer.tenet&hl=en_IN&gl=US\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">At-home COVID tests</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://inshorts.com/en/news/govt-releases-list-of-dos-and-donts-for-plasma-donation-amid-covid19-surge-1619360622862?utm_source=news_share\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Do’s and Don’ts of Plasma Donation </span></a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doctor365.co.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Online Doctor's Consultation</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Please check out this </strong></span><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UpvilfxliO5U0MzwmiYHI8I8X5GZqaG7?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Drive link</strong></span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong> to get valuable information on the availability of essential COVID supplies across several states. </strong></span><strong> </strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n","blog_headline":"To Do Or Not To Do!","user_email":"ups0408@gmail.com","user_insta":"https://instagram.com/upasana_ghosh?igshid=hld19oug325w","user_facebook":null,"user_linkedin":null,"user_name":"Upasana Ghosh","create_timestamp":"2021-04-26T11:37:32.000Z","header_img_path":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ko-7XuwM7uc7zK8xSsC8JwDV3u5s3Dhz"}],"id":"130"},"__N_SSG":true}
