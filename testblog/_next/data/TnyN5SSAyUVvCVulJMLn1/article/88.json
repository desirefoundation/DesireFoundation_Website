So, I was called for the next round of interview ; where I eventually got selected as an HR intern . I joined Desire with no bonding and expectations but ended up building a family away from family.</p>\n<p>I remember when I started working as an HR intern, I was a little frightened   as the other HR interns were talented and experienced but my coordinator never lost hope on me. She always pushed me and made me feel comfortable in the Desire environment and I ended up having a great bond with all the HR interns . Sometimes the work here gets hectic because handling the academics and co curricular activities hand in hand is not a matter of joke but I enjoyed working here. The late night work was hectic but each task made me a better individual . After a few months, I started working as a marketing intern too, as I had quite interest in marketing from the very beginning.</p>\n<p>On one such day, I got an unexpected call from our Assistant Youth Coordinator , Bhubaneswar. I was overwhelmed when I got to know that I was the new Digital Marketing Coordinator. The Journey from an intern to the Coordinator in just a few months was not at all easy. All of a sudden I got a lot of responsibilities and that was really tough for me but our Content Coordinator, Asmita Mukherjee, never left my side; she was just like the backbone to me. She taught me everything from the scratch.  Eventually I gathered numerous perceptible skills such as convincing skills , communication skills , time management skills , team leading skills and a lot more. Leading a team is not an easy task but all my interns were very supportive and they embraced me warmly. I never thought that Marketing was my thing but desire helped me find my passion and helped me brush up my skills and made me a confident individual.</p> \n<p>And now working in Desire is not an internship for me , it's my responsibility. Making those small kids smile gives happiness in itself . The slum visits are sometimes tiring but the satisfaction we gather at the end of the day is incomparable with any other wildly pleasures. Desire taught me a lot of things; no matter where I end up in my future, Desire will always have a special place in my heart. </p>\n<p>Last but not the least, proud to be a part of such an organization ... </p>\n<p>Thank you Desire for believing in me.</p>","blog_headline":"A Tale of surprises","user_email":null,"user_insta":null,"user_facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/arundhati.pande.142","user_linkedin":null,"user_name":"Arundhati Pande","create_timestamp":"2020-11-15T23:24:44.000Z","header_img_path":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1zBGx6T28rLsySSLXpN0hHePC3BYL3KNd"}],"id":"88"},"__N_SSG":true}
