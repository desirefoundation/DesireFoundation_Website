I have grown up listening to the inspirational and strenuous journeys of Swami Vivekananda at school. His life has always inspired me to do something good for the society and that is how I came across Desire Foundation, a way of putting my knowledge into a great use.</p><p>\tI've had overwhelming memories so far. From being just a member of this family and watching other members make a change to being a contributor to the change, Desire has taught me to love my work. Challenges are not sent to destroy us. They are sent to promote, increase and strengthen us, and that is what our Desire family believes in.</p><p>\tPeople often tell me, it's a waste working so hard and getting no prize. We don't bless to impress, is what I tell them because Desire has always worked for the society wanting nothing but happiness in return. Desire is a family to me where I have learnt to understand my responsibilities and surmount the obstacles.</p><p></p>","blog_headline":"My Journey","user_email":null,"user_insta":null,"user_facebook":null,"user_linkedin":null,"user_name":"Sreya Das","create_timestamp":"2020-08-23T10:35:22.000Z","header_img_path":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1B1pp_1cKBBYfSiKCJAaLiDOeDnciBfZE"}],"id":"26"},"__N_SSG":true}
