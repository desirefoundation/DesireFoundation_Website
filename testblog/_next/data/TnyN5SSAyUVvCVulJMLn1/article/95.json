{"pageProps":{"articleData":[{"pk_df_blog_page_id":95,"blog_content":"<p>It all started in mid February 2019 when there was a workshop going on in KIIT. I was in the workshop where I came to know that a recruitment drive was going on in Desire Foundation. That was the last day of the recruitment and I was already running late for the interview. \nIt is said somethings are meant to happen and becoming a part of Desire Foundation was the same. I would have missed the chance if some of my friends had not informed me about the recruitment drive. I gave the interview for Content Writer and had a mixed feeling of whether they would select me or not. Two days later I received a call where I was being welcomed to the Desire family. </p>\n<p>Not just I gained experience here but I also made wonderful memories which made me believe why this isn't just a usual KIIT society but a Family.  Each slum visit, each school visit has taught me how important education is and how lucky I am to get a chance to be a part of someone's journey from home to school. I remember how last diwali was different from all the diwalis at home or at hostel. Even today I get goosebumps when I try to remember that diwali day when those little kids smiled for a while because of us. </p>\n<p>My journey in KIIT might end in a few months but the chapters I wrote as a part of Desire Family has a big part in my life's story. </p>\n\n<p>\"Hum Rahe Ya Na Rahe <br>\nYaad Aayenge Yeh Pal\"</p>","blog_headline":"A Tale to Remember","user_email":null,"user_insta":"https://instagram.com/agrawal_aditi_?igshid=1364w4fglbkc7","user_facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/rocking.aditi.96","user_linkedin":null,"user_name":"Aditi Agrawal","create_timestamp":"2020-12-09T06:23:26.000Z","header_img_path":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Q84XqTPQvrpMYNeZLuFJd-gqX_YdFuJn"}],"id":"95"},"__N_SSG":true}
