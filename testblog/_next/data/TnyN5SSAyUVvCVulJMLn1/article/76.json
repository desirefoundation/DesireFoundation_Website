The problem of child labor is a serious matter not only in India but also in other developing countries. It is great social problem ,Children are the hope and future of a nation and  when they are supposed to study they are forced to work in farms or in road side restaurants, there are million of deprived children in our country who have never known what childhood is, they have never known the smell of the new books, they never had an opportunity to go to school and gain knowledge, life had never been fare to them. This is the change I want to bring in the world, but how?</p><p>\tIf I had power, I will make a separate department for it like CHILD POWER LINE. I will give the no. like 007 and if anyone have found that someone is force children to do work just give us a call or a missed call or can message us on the given phone no (007). That call or message will directly reach to the Police station near by the area.</p><p>\tAt the end just Remember that “Child is meant to learn not to earn.”</p><p></p>","blog_headline":"#MyPower_MyChange","user_email":null,"user_insta":"https://instagram.com/akshay_singh_k?igshid=ygihxzo4sxo4","user_facebook":null,"user_linkedin":null,"user_name":"Vishal Singh","create_timestamp":"2020-08-23T10:35:32.000Z","header_img_path":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1PgI1gZBBgpL471Pxt7V5ZpX-s1_dl0nO"}],"id":"76"},"__N_SSG":true}
