It's been that great.</p><p>\tThe day I came for the interview in Desire, I honestly didn't even know what desire did. I was always interested in sales and when I pitched them my thoughts they appreciated my ideas and honestly till then I thought that Desire sells copies to the poor people and makes them employed or does social service in that way.</p><p>\tAs my silly notion finally started to clear, I realized how valuable of a service Desire was giving to the society, and those underprivileged children.</p><p>\tMy sales and Adhyayan journey both were great. I would never take that back as both of them were complementary to each other. The sales journey gave me excitement, team-spirit, leadership skills and a sense of achievement. Whereas, my Adhyayan journey gave me the ultimate sense of fulfillment, spiritual fulfillment.</p><p>\tIt's funny now that I recall I even thought of leaving Desire just because of the morning slum visits. But my seniors reminded me of my first visit and how that changed everything, the entire perception for me. I thank them today for pushing me through it cause as I said, I wouldn't take this journey back, not for anything!</p><p></p>","blog_headline":"More like a family","user_email":null,"user_insta":null,"user_facebook":null,"user_linkedin":null,"user_name":"Shubham Kumar","create_timestamp":"2020-08-23T10:35:21.000Z","header_img_path":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1XVscHejFpotNNZFDn3f6SVG7KrK4wa2A"}],"id":"18"},"__N_SSG":true}
