{"pageProps":{"articleData":[{"pk_df_blog_page_id":96,"blog_content":"<p>\"The only thing greater than the power of the mind is the courage of the heart.\" The courage and intent of the entire team inspired me to join Desire Foundation.</p>\n<p>I have always resonated with social work. Desire Foundation allowed me to work with a group of people who are always committed to social justice and have dedicatedly enhanced the well-being and quality of life of individuals who were impacted by social disadvantages.</p>\n<p>Initially, I was overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and generosity of the people working here. Every visit, every survey helped me to better myself. \nI still remember the first survey that I was a part of, we met so many kids who were already in school because of Desire. That day I realized that I was a part of something bigger than all of us and that feeling has helped me go on.</p>\n<p>My journey so far has been so rewarding and this was possible just because of the people and their passion for doing something great. \nThank you so much, everyone.</p>","blog_headline":"A Gratifying Journey","user_email":null,"user_insta":"https://instagram.com/manasi_sharma_?igshid=15g0g0cjjrdtg","user_facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/manasi.sharma.104","user_linkedin":null,"user_name":"Manasi Sharma","create_timestamp":"2020-12-16T04:39:40.000Z","header_img_path":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ohwNMh3BaYmuIzI58J6EokvrALgAKVBn"}],"id":"96"},"__N_SSG":true}
