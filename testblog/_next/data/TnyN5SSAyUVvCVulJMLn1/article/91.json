I was in a dilemma about which society to join in but then I heard about desire from my roommate.</p>\n<p>I still remember the day when I walked in for the interview, I was so nervous, but finally, I was selected as a marketing intern. Its been one and a half years since I have been a part of this wonderful family. I got to learn so many things from my seniors be it in the academic field or marketing-related work. Desire not only gave me a platform to do something for society but it also helped me to groom myself as an individual. It helped me to learn on how to work as a team & as an individual.</p>\n<p>It always feels so nice to see a smile on the parents' faces when they say that their child got admitted to a school. I always fall short of words to express this feeling. It feels so great to realize that it's going to be almost 2 years working with desire, whereas it just feels like yesterday.</p>","blog_headline":"Never Ending Journey","user_email":"shreyamandalgm@gmail.com","user_insta":null,"user_facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/shreya.mandal.908579","user_linkedin":null,"user_name":"Shreya Mandal","create_timestamp":"2020-11-29T06:53:48.000Z","header_img_path":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1KFEJZP2nmCn8YdhS5H-o5ZizkdYvv7qF"}],"id":"91"},"__N_SSG":true}
