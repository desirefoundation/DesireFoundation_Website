Subsequently, I became a permanent member of the Desire family and started my internship with Desire. Being a part of Desire really improved my writing skills, and I gained the invaluable experience of writing about a variety of social issues. The team encouraged me to grow, professionally and improve my writing skills by giving a voice to my thoughts. I also learnt to work effectively in a team, and be a good leader.</p><p>\tDesire also gave me amazing Friendships that I will cherish always. Initially I struggled as a coordinator, but the team motivated me to continue and I was able to successfully complete a year as a coordinator. Even though I have worked with Desire from a distance, I still consider the entire team as my family, and it has been an amazing experience so far!</p><p></p>","blog_headline":"A journey of words","user_email":null,"user_insta":"https://instagram.com/annveshaa?igshid=1ewndxmijqavi","user_facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/acap1413","user_linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anwesha-chakraborty-b90b6016b/","user_name":"Anwesha Chakraborty","create_timestamp":"2020-08-23T10:35:17.000Z","header_img_path":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1fpyiF7hO5Efg7rw9uBuBkjXr0Tcp7-Wa"}],"id":"4"},"__N_SSG":true}
