He’s overwhelmed with joy to be finally out of his room after he and his family were on complete edge for the past few weeks. Rajeev decides to pay his dear cousin a visit. Rajeev has some very important advice to give to Rahul. Let’s hear him out.</em></span><em> </em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">(Rajeev opens the door to Rahul’s house. Rahul is delighted to see him and has so much to talk to him.)</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rahul: Oh, look who it is!! It’s so good to see you man. </span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: Look at you!! All fine and dandy. You really had us worried for the past few weeks.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rahul: Yes, somehow COVID caught up to me. Come on in.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: I’ll be with you in a sec…</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">(Rajeev opens his</span><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/double-masking\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> double layered mask</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">, seals them in a plastic and throws them in a dustbin. He wears a fresh mask and then washes his hands and feet with soap.)</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: I heard your COVID tests came in negative.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rahul: Yes, I’m finally COVID free. Why are you wearing a mask inside the house? It looks so odd.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: What’s odd about it? These habits will make a difference in our fight against the deadly virus. Here take one (Offers Rahul a sanitized fresh mask).</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">(Rahul puts on the mask)</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: So how are you feeling right now?</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rahul: Actually, I am relieved to be COVID free. The last few weeks were really difficult for me and the family. I still remember the constant feeling of helplessness that I had, seeing the situation of the pandemic in our country. A constant fear was looming over my mind that If my condition worsened, will I be able to get a hospital bed and the necessary medical requirements for my survival. So, I am really thankful to god<br>and to my parents who took great care of me. But…</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: What happened why did you stop?</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rahul: It’s nothing that serious. Leave it…..</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: Oh, come on. We’re the best buddies. No secrets between us…Ha ha</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rahul: Okay..Okay geez. I’m telling you. This thought is consuming me that although I tested COVID free, but still I feel weak and tired. I haven’t regained my strength back.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: So, you’re worried about this?</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rahul: Is it </span><a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/long-term-health-effects-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">normal</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: That’s completely normal Rahul. Your body has battled the virus for so many days and as a result it has become weak. So, you need to take proper care of yourself and gradually your body will recover and you’ll regain your strength.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rahul: But how long will it take? I can’t just take rest, there’s so much to do. I hate being confined in the house with nothing to do. It’s so boring. We can’t play football like the old times anymore!</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: You’re getting it wrong again. Your first priority should be your health. Have proper rest. Get enough sleep as when you sleep it speeds up the recovery procedure. Have a nutritious diet and include fruits in your diet. </span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rahul: Yes, mother provides me various nutritious fruits to eat daily. And obviously the bitter kadha is a regular practice now. I’ll definitely try to follow them.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: Also continue to monitor your blood oxygen saturation level with your oximeter. If your oxygen level dips below 90, you’ll will need to </span><a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318489\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">visit the doctor</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rahul: Yes, I have the oximeter on my bedside table. I keep a check on the readings every 6 hours.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: And are you taking the </span><a href=\"https://www.medicinenet.com/covid_19_supplements/article.htm\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">vitamin tablets</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> I told you to take? It helps in boosting the immune system.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rahul: Yes, me and my family take them regularly. Daadi forgets although and then we have to remind her.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: You can try doing some exercises. It’ll help in recovery and will improve oxygen and blood circulation. Plus, it’ll keep you engaged. Do mild exercises…don’t stress yourself out. You remember the </span><a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/best-home-exercises-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">list of exercises</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">  I sent you last day? Try doing those.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rahul: Yeah, I saw that. I’ll start with the exercises today. And I’m also doing regular gargles and taking steam.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: It’s good to hear that. And don’t forget the most important RULE.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rahul: What’s that?</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: Don’t go outside unless absolutely necessary and maintain social distancing. Always wear a mask. Don’t let your guard down. There have been instances of relapses of COVID in people who recovered from COVID.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rahul: Oh yes, how could I forget. Ha ha… Come on now stop lecturing me. Let’s watch a movie together.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: Sounds like a good idea.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rahul: I am thankful to god that I survived through this somehow.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: But our fight is far from over. The number of infections everydayis reaching sky high and are breaking all records. The death is also on an all-time high. In this situation of horror, the medical infrastructure is being pushed beyond its limits. Hospitals are also facing a severe oxygen shortage. The people have joined together to find oxygen cylinders from various sources and are trying to make them available to the one’s needing it the most and saving lives.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rahul: I also want to do my bit. After fighting the virus, myself, I too want to join this fight against COVID.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: That’s great!! There are many organizations who share verified information on social media platforms about the availability of hospital beds, ambulances, oxygen supply etc. They need our help to amplify the reach of their posts so that more and more people can know about this and the ones in need can get help at the earliest.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rahul: That sounds like a great idea.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: But remember to share the latest news as with every passing hour the availability of hospital beds and other key medical equipment’s is changing. So, the information shared the day before might not be valid for today.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Rajeev: Okay, I’ll keep that in mind.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><ins>IMPORTANT LINKS MENTIONED:</ins></strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/double-masking\" target=\"_blank\">Importance of Double Masking</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/long-term-health-effects-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\">Long-term Health Effects of COVID-19</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.medicinenet.com/covid_19_supplements/article.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Vitamins to build Immunity</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/best-home-exercises-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\">Exercises to build Immunity</a><span style=\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 16px;font-family: Open Sans\", sans;\"><strong> </strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Please click on these links to get information regarding COVID Resources:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin-left:1.5em;\">&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UpvilfxliO5U0MzwmiYHI8I8X5GZqaG7\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,123,255);background-color: transparent;font-size: 16px;font-family: Open Sans\", sans;\">Information Regarding COVID resources all over India</span></a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"margin-left:1.5em;\">&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hcPMvu3tV8dl8UpsNvo5Ls_11kWUZ34HSIQ1rKcKbHg/edit#gid=634296280\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,123,255);background-color: transparent;font-size: 16px;font-family: Open Sans\", sans;\">Verified Contacts of COVID resources in certain states</span></a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"></p>\n<p><br>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n","blog_headline":"Rahul's COVID Journey: Chapter 4","user_email":"rick.das.private@gmail.com","user_insta":null,"user_facebook":null,"user_linkedin":null,"user_name":"Rohan Das","create_timestamp":"2021-05-22T01:29:03.000Z","header_img_path":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=11xMiqZLPTob3OaTu4gh9xoh-londVww1"}],"id":"139"},"__N_SSG":true}
