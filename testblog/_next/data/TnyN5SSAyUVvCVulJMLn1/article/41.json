Education is the most powerful medium to express what we have, what we think, what we believe, what we see and what we hear. It is the interface between knowledge and the homo sapien. It is our very own platform which builds a uniform population.When those kids carry bags full of books and pens and walk their way to the school and while they study sitting on the benches, with their friends, and the teachers teaching them and writing on the blackboard, there gets a path to the brightest economy of the country being built.</p><p>\tËœThe classroom that we give them is the economy we build for tomorrow.</p><p>\tThe books that we give them is the blocks of the society we build for tomorrow.</p><p>\tThe hand that we give them is the unity we build for tomorrow.</p><p>\tToday is the International Literacy Day.

The very thought that education is the gift that males get and a curse for the females followed by the question as to what benefit it will give when females get married and their work is in the household chores.

Or do we take an oath to literate ourselves? Literacy needs to be seeped into the roots of humanity and this will be possible only when our own hands nourish it with water and fertilizers. Literacy is achieved at the individual level more than the government being responsible for our own education. If the Government is taking one step forward, it is we who are to take the other step.
