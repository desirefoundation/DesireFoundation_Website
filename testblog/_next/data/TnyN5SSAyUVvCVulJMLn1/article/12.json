That urge to make a name somewhere in this competitive world, made me join this organization named, Desire Foundation.</p><p>\tLittle did I know, that in search of personality development, I would end up becoming a better human being, who now looks at life more than a blessing.</p><p>\tI'm honored to share these experiences with these bunch of people who are willing to put in every effort to change lives and make this world a better place to live in.</p><p>\tMy journey from giving an interview to taking one, from just attending a meeting to organizing one, from a follower to a leader, has been incredibly amazing. And I owe it all to this set of exceptional mentors and seniors who have always been there for every inch of assistance and literally taught me the difference between ˜a leader' and ˜a boss'.</p><p>\tDesire has not only given me these experiences but also a sense of motive in life, in a very unusual way.</p><p>\tThe impact of our work might be very trivial compared to the countless issues faced by our society, but we know that big changes come with small steps. And I wish to be a part of this journey through all these miles.</p><p></p>","blog_headline":"Growing with Desire","user_email":null,"user_insta":"https://instagram.com/_sweksha_sharma_?igshid=1tk5z6z0sma6x","user_facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/sweksha.sharma.3","user_linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sweksha-sharma-5a0306184/","user_name":"Sweksha Sharma","create_timestamp":"2020-08-23T10:35:20.000Z","header_img_path":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1FkB-deQ5TQubcCFvkde8pNleR1_UOQmX"}],"id":"12"},"__N_SSG":true}
