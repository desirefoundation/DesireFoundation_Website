Rajeev decides to talk to home-isolated Rahul and mentally support him in his tough times. Let’s delve into their conversation.</em></span><em> </em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rajeev:</strong> Hey Rahul, just came to know about you being tested positive. How are you doing today?</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rahul:</strong> Hello, thanks for your concern. I am doing just the same today, with moderate symptoms and complete lack of taste and smell.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rajeev:</strong> How much fever are you having currently?</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rahul:</strong> I had around 101 fever this morning, so took a paracetamol post breakfast. Other than that, I am having mild cold and cough, and a sore throat.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rajeev:</strong> Your voice also sounds quite tired, please take all the medications on time and maintain complete bed rest!</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rahul: </strong>But I am feeling low. I have made all my family vulnerable to the disease. I am feeling very unhappy. What should I so that I do not spread this disease to anyone else?</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rajeev:</strong> Firstly, calm down. You are over-thinking. If you take all the precautionary measures, you won’t spread the virus to anyone else in the family. I hope you have completely isolated yourself in your house.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rahul:</strong> Oh yes. I am using a separate room and washroom. Papa has kept all my medicines by my bed which will last for at least 21days. I also have a timetable on when and how to intake these. Maa comes and keeps the food on a distant table and I take the plate from there. I sanitise my room thrice a day, and Dadi is never allowed to come near my room. I also keep sanitizing my hand as many times as possible, and incase I sneeze or cough, I use towels to clean myself with. These are all the</span><a href=\"https://patient.info/news-and-features/covid-19-coronavirus-how-to-self-isolate\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"> precautions</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"> taken by us so far.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rajeev:</strong> Great! You have really become quite responsible. Also make sure to keep your masks on even inside the house. </span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rahul:</strong> What? But why! Why should we use masks inside our house? </span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rajeev:</strong> You, along with your family, must use masks even inside the house because while using a mask, prevent yourself from spreading the virus. I know it may get quite uncomfortable, but after all it’s just a matter of a few days. Prevention is better than cure. You </span> <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\">can prevent any other member of your family from getting infected this way.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rahul:</strong> Thank you for the suggestion! We will surely take care of it. But what should I do for this lack of taste and smell I am having right now? I feel so numb.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rajeev:</strong> Oh you can’t do anything about it! The lack of taste and smell is a side-effect of this virus. But you can always work on bringing back your senses as soon as possible by intaking the “home made karha” twice a day. Scientists have actually confirmed that “Karha” has immune-boosting effects and the property to clean your body. </span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rahul:</strong> I’ve heard that obesity is a major risk factor for COVID-19. Is it true?</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Raajeev:</strong> Yes it is. You can know more </span><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(21)00089-9/fulltextfbclid=IwAR12YQiUubEMaSCC6SBistmOU0j14bEe7y6OzsYC5MkkNA74pdCgYDtDkzE\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rajeev:</strong> You’ll have to boost your immunity in order to stay strong, and for that – a healthy diet with lots of fruits, vegetables and protein is completely necessary. Also, drink atleast 2-3L of water every day to flush out any impurity from your body. Regarding medicines, never miss one, most of your medicines are vitamin supplements, zinc supplements and immunisers; which are necessary to your body in this phase.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rahul:</strong> Sure, I’ll keep all your advices in mind. One more thing, please tell me what to do in this isolation time. Sometimes I feel that I won’t be able to fight this virus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rajeev:</strong> Why are you feeling that you won’t be able to fight the virus? And you are on the correct medication and precautionary measures. You’ll obviously hail on. </span><br><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\">And for your boredom in isolation, why don’t you try </span><a href=\"http://blog.desirefoundation.org/article/?id=132\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\">these</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"> out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rahul:</strong> Thank you for helping me out and supporting me like this in this tough time. </span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rajeev:</strong> Take good<br>care of yourself, and keep resting, since you’ll have to defeat that virus out<br>there, right? Don’t worry, you’ll be fine.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold\", sans-serif;\"><strong>Rahul:</strong> Yes, I will.
