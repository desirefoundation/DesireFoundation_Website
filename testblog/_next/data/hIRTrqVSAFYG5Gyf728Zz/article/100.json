In a tough time like this, when the whole world looked pale and hopeless,<a href=\"http://desirefoundation.org/\"> Desire Foundation</a> was successful in undertaking a number of measures to help those in need, and what a year we had! <br /> As we lean upon the exit gate of this year, hoping for a better tomorrow, we look back at all our ventures that we successfully undertook &nbsp;this &nbsp;year and cheer for ourselves.</p>\n<p>We have completed our journey of Adhyayan-4. Let us look back on the year we had.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://desirefoundation.org/p_adhyayan.html\">Adhyayan</a> is a programme that &nbsp;aspires to achieve a goal: the goal to have a country where every child is able to receive quality education.Under the ambit of RTE Act 12(1)(c), Desire Foundation was successful in admitting 95 children from EWS category to schools for 2020-2021.</p>\n<p>Biswajit Sahoo is thankful to have received the gift of knowledge this year. For him, Santa has brought a bag full of books and cup full of memories.</p>\n<p>On the event of Raksha Bandhan 2019, Desire Foundation went to an orphanage for girls, Kiran Orphanage, where 20 little girls tied rakhis&nbsp; to our members and in turn were gifted with notebooks, pencils and chocolates. It was a small effort to give them the sense of a family during the festive season.</p>\n<p>Jhimi Rani Nayak says that all she ever wished for was a family and through Desire she has found one. All her newly made brothers and sisters have helped her in getting admitted to a new school and she smiles today with a backpack full of books and hopes.</p>\n<p>To illuminate the lives of slum-dwellers during the festival of lights, members of Desire Foundation visited 50 families and distributed sweets and stationaries to children at Mahimanagar slum. This act of celebrating a cracker-free-pollution-free Diwali&rsquo;19 <a href=\"http://desirefoundation.org/e_diwali.html\">under the project Adhyayan</a> led the children to relish the festival in a different light.</p>\n<p>Md. Zisan had never celebrated Diwali. This year, he felt the lights brightening in his eyes as he was able to experience the light of knowledge. He thanks all our members with moist eyes for the gift of a bright future ahead.</p>\n<p>What next?</p>\n<p>We have already begun our next journey,that is Adhyayan-5. Aspiring to achieve a 120+ admission count this year, we have embarked upon a remarkable ride for the next year.</p>\n<p>In June 2020, our programme, Ashray, was able to provide twice-a-day meals to 30 homeless individuals for thirty days.<br /> <br /> As an innovative way to put forward the struggles and successes of people working hard to make the society a better place, our podcast series, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Unwind&rdquo; was&nbsp; launched on YouTube. Countless inspiring stories were heard on this platform.</p>\n<p>Another wonderful initiative,the &ldquo;Sponsor a Child&rdquo; programme has been initiated allowing needy children to be provided with the fee of their education. The generous sponsors have already spread joy to 5 children. We further aspire to help another 20 children in the coming months.</p>\n<p>We are glad that our tiny efforts have been really fruitful and we have been successful in our ventures so far. We have expanded our horizons to online programmes, online surveys, blogs, websites, channels and a larger area of concern. Keeping our successes in mind, we are sincerely grateful to each and every member of our family for their contributions. We hope that the years to come are even more impactful and we are able to reach to every needy child of this country.</p>\n<p>A big thank you to several other organizations who have been trying so hard to do the best in their power for the good of mankind.<br /> Do check out the websites of the following organisations to learn about the amazing work they are doing!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ThinkZone India: <a href=\"https://thinkzone.in/\">https://thinkzone.in/</a></li>\n<li>i-Saksham: <a href=\"https://www.i-saksham.org/\">https://www.i-saksham.org/</a></li>\n<li>Plan India: <a href=\"https://www.planindia.org/\">https://www.planindia.org/</a></li>\n<li>CRY (Child Rights and You): <a href=\"https://www.cry.org/\">https://www.cry.org/</a></li>\n<li>Katha Foundation: <a href=\"https://www.katha.org/\">https://www.katha.org/</a></li>\n</ul>\n","blog_headline":"WHAT A YEAR IT WAS!","user_email":"ups0408@gmail.com","user_insta":"https://instagram.com/upasana_ghosh?igshid=hld19oug325w","user_facebook":null,"user_linkedin":null,"user_name":"Upasana Ghosh","create_timestamp":"2020-12-25T21:27:18.000Z","header_img_path":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1rt6KOCleMhjUlJxwZNGYIujLmWQcfIsY"}],"id":"100"},"__N_SSG":true}
