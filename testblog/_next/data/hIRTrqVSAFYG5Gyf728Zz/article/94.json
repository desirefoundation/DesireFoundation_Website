{"pageProps":{"articleData":[{"pk_df_blog_page_id":94,"blog_content":"<p>From the society announcements during the class hours, I heard an announcement of getting a winter internship in IIM-A being an intern in Desire Foundation. I got super excited and reached for the Interview along with some of my friends. Being completely clueless about the Foundation I was asked about the current projects named ADHYAYAN. My interviewer who was my senior Bhaiya asked me to search in Facebook for further conduction of my interview that was quite memorable at the same time a little embarrassing. Later, I was called for being selected as a Digital Marketing Intern.</p>\n<p>So here is how my Journey with Desire starts. </p>\n<p>I was so glad, the day I filled the form for 3 small kids, that I realised being the part of this Foundation has got a lot more than the internship for which I joined Desire. Those slum visits, the dreams in the eyes of those small kids really drove me crazy to get them the best possible education to fulfill their dreams. Beyond these experience, I am having a family away from home with whom I celebrate Diwali, Raksha Bandhan and many festivals along with those small kids who show us the real meaning of life and Happiness. </p>","blog_headline":"My Journey of Akankshya Panda","user_email":null,"user_insta":"https://instagram.com/miss_fin_gourmet?igshid=1v5usahqe2vjf","user_facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/samarendu.panda","user_linkedin":null,"user_name":"Akankshya Panda","create_timestamp":"2020-12-07T06:41:21.000Z","header_img_path":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1wWVP78k--wwfj5C4qfX9wLaJelhtmMC4"}],"id":"94"},"__N_SSG":true}
