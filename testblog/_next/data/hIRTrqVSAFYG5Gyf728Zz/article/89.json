Personality development and working for society was always my primary priority. Iâ€™m honored that I met these bunch of people who are putting an effort to change the lives of little kids and making the world a better place to live.</p>\n<p>I remember my interview day, I came for HR interview but ended up being selected in Content department. Earlier I wrote some articles for school magazines but Desire gave me a purpose to write. Writing as we know, has the power to influence the world. My coordinators Anwesha and Tithikyu bhaiya motivated me a lot. I learnt how to gather my thoughts and put them in an organised manner. And one of the happiest moment was when I received my first Intern of the Month.</p>\n<p>Except writing, Desire has helped me in developing my overall personality. I never thought of going door to door selling copies. The work of Adhyayan, telling people about us and after the admission seeing the smiling faces of those kids gave so much relief to me. At one point, as I went on for my first slum visit I found out that there was no slum. I was very annoyed and disappointed at that time, but my seniors motivated me, saying that it happens. Then I realised that doing something for society to change it would not be an easy task.</p>\n<p>I have no words left to say about Desire. I have a lot of blemishes but Desire taught me how to overcome my weaknesses and outshine by improving myself day by day.</p>","blog_headline":"My Journey - Divyanshi Raghuvanshi","user_email":null,"user_insta":"https://www.instagram.com/divyanshi.raghuvanshi.2/","user_facebook":null,"user_linkedin":null,"user_name":"Divyanshi Raghuvanshi","create_timestamp":"2020-11-21T05:26:56.000Z","header_img_path":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1S7U1lL5vywOg6Y9mnfKxTog_IXPDbNus"}],"id":"89"},"__N_SSG":true}
