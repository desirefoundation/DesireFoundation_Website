Randomly landed for an interview along with 3 of my friends ,initially my idea wasn't so clear about Desire , though I roughly knew the outline of its functioning. Initially I applied as a HR intern but, finally my finesse in the skill of selling that too with a warm smile got me a spot in the Sales department . The day also taught me that a smile and fearless actions are the key to master the most hyped times in life too. From the time I got on board I made quite new friends with some being too special and guiding my way out of tough situations and even sharing my work loads to meet the deadlines. Soon I realised the crux of my past experiences dating back to my stay at my hometown Muzaffarpur needed to be at test for the needs of the underprivileged as I started going on slum visits and creating an unconventional bond of belonging with them. With this spirit I started my journey from a Sales intern to becoming an Adhyayan coordinator .After being the coordinator I really felt how much We as people who got so many privileges need to cater to the pain of these individuals. Not only have I grown out my personality for the better but have also felt the happiness seeing the children get admission in good schools and being proud that I and my Desire Family has been a part in their life's beginning towards a bright future.</p><p></p>","blog_headline":"Uncertainty and a smile is the way","user_email":null,"user_insta":"https://instagram.com/parthgautamm?igshid=1cvsw9wiubs17","user_facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/parthgautam97","user_linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/parth-gautam-629ba41a3/","user_name":"Parth Gautam","create_timestamp":"2020-08-23T10:35:23.000Z","header_img_path":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1JxvJHbY-VTS49kaALMfZdtrz8rRachND"}],"id":"32"},"__N_SSG":true}
