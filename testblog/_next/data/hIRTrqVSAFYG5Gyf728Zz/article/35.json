Nothing,right?</p><p>\tWell that is what my life would be,had I not been associated with Desire Foundation. An urge to get into one of the college societies led me to this organization and I am grateful to that day when I first saw the very unusual name of it. Being afraid at first how to encounter the new people I convinced three of my friends to get along,and it is a matter to get glad about that they are still with me on this enthralling journey.From being  afraid to stand and talk in front of unknowns to leading a group of 100s .Not every day at Desire was a cake walk, but we made sure to end each day with smile and energy so as to accomplish the tasks for the next day and will go on doing that, to bring the smiles not only on my face or my friends faces but to bring the smile on the faces of those who forgot what actually smile is,at the end of the day when I go to bed I have that satisfaction, that this was another day where i was the reason for someoneâ€™s happiness.  Being in my final year of college, I must say that days spent with Desire are the unforgettable ones.</p><p></p>","blog_headline":"My Journey","user_email":null,"user_insta":"https://instagram.com/shubhilal?igshid=1247wu840aqsy","user_facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/shubhi.lal","user_linkedin":null,"user_name":"Shubhi Lal","create_timestamp":"2020-08-23T10:35:24.000Z","header_img_path":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1kmFD-qHepqpESutGwv_WyV1PTaVBgP1H"}],"id":"35"},"__N_SSG":true}
