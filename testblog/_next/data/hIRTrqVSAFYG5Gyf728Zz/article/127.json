But presently, there exists a very large group of people who are not\n\t\tacquainted with this side of life. AND still there are people who defy to accept the fate and rebel against the\n\t\tsystem. One person of such kind was <strong>Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</strong>.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: white;font-size: 13.5pt;font-family: Segoe UI\" ,\n\t\tsans-serif;\"><strong><ins>Key takeaways from this article: </ins></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: white;font-size: 13.5pt;font-family: Segoe UI\" ,\n\t\tsans-serif;\">&gt; The staggering tragedies in the early life of Dr. B.R.

He was not even allowed to drink water from public containers. One peon had to pour\n\t\twater from a height on his hand and only then could<br>he drink. There used to be the times when the peon was\n\t\tnot around to pour water to him which was when he coined the phrase </span><a\n\t\thref=\"http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_waiting.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span\n\t\t\tstyle=\"color: rgb(0,123,255);background-color: white;font-size: 13.5pt;font-family: Segoe UI\" ,\n\t\t\tsans-serif;\">'No Peon No Water'</span></a><span\n\t\tstyle=\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: white;font-size: 13.5pt;font-family: Segoe UI\" , sans-serif;\">.\n\t</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: white;font-size: 13.5pt;font-family: Segoe UI\" , sans-serif;\">He\n\t\twas also the 14th child of a not-so-well-to-do family. You can only imagine how difficult it must have been to\n\t\tbe in his shoes. But even then he was a far sighted child. Who could have known at that time that a child\n\t\tstruggling would be making all struggles worthwhile and not just for him or his family alone but for a very\n\t\tlarge group of oppressed people? He is without a doubt no less than a God for many.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: white;font-size: 13.5pt;font-family: Segoe UI\" ,\n\t\tsans-serif;\">Despite being the 14th child of his family, Ambedkar had a fire within himself. A fire to rebel.\n\t\tAnd in his fight against the system, one of the brutal weapons was EDUCATION. He believed that education and\n\t\tknowledge has the power to overturn the reign of wrong-doers. Despite all odds, he studied so hard from the very\n\t\tschool that oppressed him that his teachers were so proud of him. One of the teachers (Mr. Mahadev Ambedkar)\n\t\tgave his surname to the little Bhimrao whose initial surname was 'Ambavadekar'. He then not only completed his\n\t\telementary education (which most of his siblings were not able to) but also went for higher education in some\n\t\trenowned colleges of the World. You ask why would one go so far against all the frictions? It was because of his\n\t\tone true belief that <strong>EDUCATION CAN BRING A CHANGE.</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Zbjl00cskUk5aHsl41g0mAUmjgJ-NnaY\" alt=\"undefined\"\n\tstyle=\"height: auto;width: auto\" />\n<p></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: white;font-size: 13.5pt;font-family: Segoe UI\" , sans-serif;\">It\n\t\twas only because of his sheer inner motivation that he achieved such heights of success in his life.

He, along with other\n\t\thounourable members, drafted the most important document for a country, the CONSTITUTION, in less than 3 years\n\t\twhich is an achievement in itself. This couldn't have been done with motivation alone. Proper education and\n\t\tpractical knowledge were both required for the same. In the constitution, he has given a very high importance to\n\t\tthe implementation of equality in the field of education, since his fight was based on education\n\t\titself.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: white;font-size: 13.5pt;font-family: Segoe UI\" ,\n\t\tsans-serif;\">Check out more of our blogs on Education and Right To Eduction </span><a\n\t\thref=\"http://blog.desirefoundation.org/category?id=Education%20and%20RTE\" target=\"_blank\"><span\n\t\t\tstyle=\"color: rgb(0,123,255);background-color: white;font-size: 13.5pt;font-family: Segoe UI\" ,\n\t\t\tsans-serif;\">here</span></a><span\n\t\tstyle=\"color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: white;font-size: 13.5pt;font-family: Segoe UI\" ,\n\t\tsans-serif;\">.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","blog_headline":"The Amazing Dr. Ambedkar","user_email":"mohitdj1221@gmail.com","user_insta":"@mohit_wolff","user_facebook":"","user_linkedin":"","user_name":"Mohit Raj","create_timestamp":"2021-04-13T13:10:25.000Z","header_img_path":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1dzDqGJFE1agZ3H3pzElR1D0NDUnj0XOz"}],"id":"127"},"__N_SSG":true}
